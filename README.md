# A Star

To my knowledge, the A* algorithm is the fastest, most optimal way to figure out the shortest path from point A to point B on a coordinate plain. This script is very basic, and serves merely as an example!

## What is A*?

A* is "An efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph, often used in video games and GPS navigation. It is known for its optimality and speed because it uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance to the goal, guiding the search more effectively than other methods."

## What does this script do?

Utilizing pygame, this script serves as a vizualizer for the A* algorithm

## How does I use this script?

Don't worry, It's simple!

1. Clone this repository onto your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/Tranquil-M/A-Star
```
2. Install pygame
```
python -m pip install pygame-ce
```
3. Move into the A-Star directory
```
cd ./A-Star
```
4. Run main.py
```
python main.py

```

# Controls

* Left click to place a start node
* After a start node has been placed, click again to add an end node
* After both nodes are present, click anywhere else to add an obstacle.
* Press space to run the algorithm
* Press c to clear the board
